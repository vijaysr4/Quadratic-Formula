# Quadratic Formula
In algebra, a quadratic equation is an equation having the form:

ax<sup>2</sup> + bx + c = 0ax

The corresponding x values are the x-intercepts of the graph, while a, b, and c are constants.

This C++ program called quadratic.cpp that solves the quadratic equation for the xâ€˜s:


```math
\[\large x = \frac{-b\pm\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}\]
```
and line math $`a^2 + b^2 = c^2`$.

\[\large x = \frac{-b\pm\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}\]

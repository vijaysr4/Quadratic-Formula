In algebra, a quadratic equation is an equation having the form:

ax<sup>2</sup> + bx + c = 0ax

The corresponding x values are the x-intercepts of the graph, while a, b, and c are constants.

This C++ program called quadratic.cpp that solves the quadratic equation for the x‘s:

![\Large x=\frac{-b\pm\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?x%3D%5Cfrac%7B-b%5Cpm%5Csqrt%7Bb%5E2-4ac%7D%7D%7B2a%7D)
